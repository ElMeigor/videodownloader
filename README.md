A simple python script to download youtube videos <br />
Known issues - Age Restriction <br />
  -Currently can not bypass age restriction. Will take a look into this when I get the time <br />
Be sure to download the correct version :) <br />
Future Updates <br />
  -Compatible ICO icon  <br />
  -Possibly change the GUI  <br />
<br />
**Note**<br />
There may be a flag on the windows version for Trojan, this should be fixed now as I repackaged it without --onefile <br />
If there is an issue please reach out to me on discord or something meister7625
